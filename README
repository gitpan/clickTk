1. What is clickTk?

clickTk is a graphical editor that helps Perl/Tk programmers to create Perl/Tk 
applications consisting of several more or less sophisticated dialogs. 
The main goal is to generate Perl/Tk code in form of scripts, subroutines and 
classes which can be embedded in the application with or without minor manual 
interventions. 
Once the dialog flow is designed and the individual dialogs have been sketched, 
clickTk can be used to generate the corresponding Perl/Tk source code. 
Moreover, it can be used on the one hand to easily create some different 
versions of a dialog flow and on the other hand to refine the chosen version to 
its ultimate state. 
The ability to generate additional run code to the dialog definitions itself 
allows the programmer to already do some unit tests during the development 
session, with the advantage that the exported code has already been tested, when 
it will run in the application environment. 
Therefore, clickTk considerably reduces the extremely tedious and error prone 
coding of complex widget definitions on the one hand assisting the input of 
options with preformatted dialogs and on the other hand allowing the use of 
templates. 
Further, clickTk allows to separate the code related to the presentation's 
functionality from the application logic. 
In consequence, it is easier to develop specialized widgets, a fact that 
simplifies the application's code and significantly increases the quality of the 
application's design.

3.2 Installing an upgrade


  - Read the installation's notes.

  - Download the clickTk intallation's archive 
    into the dedicated folder. 

  - Unpack the archive into a new folder.

  - Merge your projects, works, template, widgets definitions and shells into the
    new folder.

  - Run the upgrade scripts if any has been provided and mentioned 
    in the readme installation's notes.
 
  - Start some sessions to check whether the new version works fine.
